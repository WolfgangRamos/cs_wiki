#+TITLE: Domain Driven Design

* Domain Driven Design

- Useful for software with complex business logic
- Not useful for
  - high performance
  - big data
  - technical complex software (e.g. with special hardware requirements)
- Focuses on
  - focus (YAGNI)
  - simplification (KISS)

** Main Concepts

- Ubiquitous Language: shared language between developers and project managers, sales, etc.
- Bounded context: separate different parts of the system
- Domain (aka Problem Domain): The actual problem that the software is solving
- Core Domain (the part of the problem domain that cannot be delegated
  to third-party applications): Focus on the most important part of
  the system
- Business Logic (aka Domain Logic aka Business Rules aka Domain
  Knowledge aka Domain Model):
  - usually in layer 1 and 2 of the onion architecture
- Problem = the reason why the project is created
- Solution = the artifact that is created to solve the problem

*** Onion Architecture

- layer 1 (most inner): contains business logic
  - entities
  - value objects
  - domain events
  - aggregates
- layer 2
  - repositories and DB (table) mappers encapsulate the DB
    (persistence)
  - factories: construction
  - domain services
- layer 3
  - application services (e.g. ViewModels in MVVM)
    - coordinate communication between domain classes and UI (outside world)
    - validate inputs from UI (outside world)
- layer 4
  - UI
- classes in layer 1 and 2 are also called /Domain Classes/ because they
  implement the domain logic

* Entities and Value objects

- reference equality: same address in memory
- identifier equality: same ID field value memory
- structural equality: all members match
- entities
  - are (almost always) mutable
  - only use identifier equality
  - are persisted
- value objects
  - use structural equality
  - are immutable
  - are owned by entities (i.e. they share the lifetime of its
    owner)
  - are (usually) persisted in-lined into owner tables
- How to identify if a type is value objects:
  - Could instances of this type be replaced with structurally
    identical instances (e.g. like integers)
  - Look for fields that are always changed together
- Always prefer value objects to entities
  - are more light-weight
  - put most of the business logic into value objects (and let
    entities act as wrappers)
- why not use C# =struct= or =record= types for value objects?
  - immutable fields are often not supported by ORM (as is the case
    for NHibernate and EF Core)
  - do not support inheritance (no way to abstract value object
    behavior)

* Persistence with ORM

- ORM = object relational mappers
- Decoupling of Entity Classes from persistence functionality
- Primary Key Assignment Strategies
  - Use SQL Identity Column feature
  - Use GUIDs
  - Use Hi/Lo Algorithm to retrieve batches of IDs:
    - What is Hi/Lo:
      https://stackoverflow.com/questions/282099/whats-the-hi-lo-algorithm/282113#282113
    - EF Core support for Hi/Lo:
      https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.entityframeworkcore.sqlserverpropertybuilderextensions.usehilo?view=efcore-3.0

* Aggregates

- aggregates encapsulate combinations of entities
- every aggregate
  - has a set of invariants (that it maintains during its lifetime)
  - should have a root entity:
    - avoid exposing non-root entities as much as possible
    - classes outside the aggregate can only hold permanent references
      to the root entity, references to any non-root entity should
      only be held temporarily (e.g. as a local variable in a method)
  - has to be saved in a transaction (i.e. save all entities at once,
    not separately to maintain consistency)
  - invariants spanning across several aggregates are only eventually
    consistent
- guidelines for choosing boundaries for aggregates
  - central question: Does an entity make sense without some other
    entity? (aka is the lifetime of some sub-entity bound to the
    lifetime of some root-entity? see also [[file:uml.org::#relationships][UML Composition
    relationship]])
  - high cohesion within aggregates
  - low coupling between aggregates
  - usually contains at max 3 entities

* Repository (Pattern)

- repositories encapsulate all persistence related (business) logic
  (i.e. reading and writing from/to some kind of data storage/database)
- only aggregate-roots should be available through repositories
- one repository for each aggregate root-entity (this repository can
  contain root-entity-specific read and write methods)
- public methods should only work with root-entities
- get sub-entities only through their root-entities

** Reducing Repository Interfaces

1. Specification Pattern
2. Use one generic interface for all repositories
3. Define separate repository interfaces for reading and writing

*** Specification Pattern

- a specification is a predicate that determines if an object satisfies some
  criteria
- some specifications can be translated by ORMs to filter operations
  that execute on the DBMS
- specifications are used to specify the state of an object
  - validation
  - selection and querying
  - creation for specific purposes
- Reference implementation: https://www.nuget.org/packages/Ardalis.Specification
- specifications are value objects

** The False Myth of Abstracting the Database

- source: https://enterprisecraftsmanship.com/posts/should-you-abstract-database/
- pros and cons of abstracting the database
  - pros
    - avoid vendor lock-in
  - cons
    - any abstraction can only rely on features that are available in
      all DBMS systems (i.e. it cannot advance features of individual
      DBMS)
    - high maintenance cost for a feature that might never be needed
- because of the cons, abstracting your database is an anti-pattern

** Reference Data

- reference data = data that is predefined (i.e. a table in the DB
  that can contain only predefined rows that users cannot change
  directly)
- reference data can be modeled with static instances in the code
- integration tests are necessary to check that the static instances
  and the rows in the DB match

* Bounded Context

- a bounded context is a part of the solution (artifacts)
- bounded contexts and subdomains
  - subdomain belongs to the problem space, i.e. it is part of the
    problem
  - bounded contexts are part of the solution space, i.e. it is a part
    of the solution
  - there should be one bounded context for each subdomain (not
    always possible; in legacy projects it's sometimes good to create
    a new bounded context for new functionality for the same
    subdomain)
  - one subdomain might be covered by several bounded context
    (especially in legacy projects), but each bounded context should
    cover only one subdomain
- bounded context help reduce communication overhead across team
  boundaries, i.e. bounded contexts should not be share across teams
  (but one team might be working on several bounded contexts)
- if two bounded contexts share code (value objects, domain and
  utility classes), created a shared kernel
- choosing boundaries for bounded contexts
  - identify subdomains (and create one bounded context for each)
  - other rule of thumbs for splitting up a bounded context. Split up
    a bounded context if
    - it cannot be covered by one team with 5 to 7 developers
    - its code base is too large (to decrease mental load for
      developers)

** Isolation of Bounded Contexts

- types of isolation (ordered from low to high isolation)
  1. separate namespaces in the same assembly
     - cons
       - shared database (but each bounded context should define a
         separate database schemata)
  2. separate assemblies
  3. separate processes, i.e. separately deployed (micro) services
- higher isolation
  - requires more maintenance
  - ensures that isolation is not violated easily
- use higher isolation only when the benefits outweigh the costs

** Communication Between Bounded Contexts

- the way in which entities in two different bounded contexts
  communicate with each other depends on the isolation of the bounded
  contexts
- for isolation type 1 or 2 (separate namespaces in the same assembly
  or separate assemblies)
  - when the bounded contexts are *not* separated by an anti-corruption
    layer
    - direct calls: entities from one bounded context can just call
      the methods of entities from the other context
    - domain events: entities from one bounded context can just
      subscribe to the events of entities from the other bounded
      context
  - when the bounded context are separated by an anti-corruption
    layer, entities from one bounded context can call entities from
    the other context only through proxies
- for isolation type 3 (separate processes): communication through
  network or message queues (this message exchange mechanism act as
  anti-corruption layer)

** Anti-Corruption Layer

- a unilateral facade/adapter layer between different bounded contexts
  (or systems) that don't share the same semantics
- Examples
  - ViewModels are anti-corruption layers toward the UI (aka View)
  - Repositories are anti-corruption layers toward the DB

** Code reuse across bounded context

- usually it is best to avoid reusing code across domains
- code carrying business logic
  - should not be reused (unless they really model the same concept in all bounded contexts)
  - extract to a shared kernel
- domain base classes (e.g. =Entity= or =Aggregate=)
  - reuse them in a single team only
- utility code
  - reuse them in a single team only
  - reuse across team only if it provides a lot of value

* Domain Events

- decouple different bounded contexts or entities within the same
  bounded contexts from one another
- allow communication between bounded contexts without bidirectional
  relationships
- guidelines for defining domain events
  - use past-tense names
  - event data should be immutable
  - included as little data as possible
  - events should be data structures (i.e. they should not have behavior)
  - do not put domain classes in events (always use primitive data)

** How to deliver events

- events can be physically delivered via
  - in memory data structures (when both bounded contexts run in the
    same process)
  - service bus (when both bounded contexts run in different
    processes)
    - the bounded context that produces the event is responsible for
      dispatching the event to the service bus

** Raising Domain Events

- event raisers and handlers are domain services (entity classes
  shouldn't know anything about raising or handling of events)
- for a clean implementation creation and dispatching have to be
  separated
- domain entities are responsible for creating events, but not for
  raising them
- when entities raise events themselves
  - they communicate with the outside world
  - it's hard to implement "units of work", i.e. freely compose
    operations and events (e.g. do multiple operations and raise
    multiple events at different points in between)
- events should only be raised when the changed data was successfully
  validated (i.e. the entity was persisted)
- unit or work: https://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/unitOfWork.html

* Always-Valid and Not-Always-Valid approach

- Always-Valid approach:
  - Operations that lead to invalid states should throw exceptions
  - validation should be performed in the application services
    using =CanXyz= defined queries in the entities
- Not-Always-Valid approach
  - temporarily allow invalid states during operations
- Pros and Cons of Always-Valid approach
  - Pros
    - developers can be sure that entities are always valid
    - supports fail fast principle:
      https://enterprisecraftsmanship.com/posts/fail-fast-principle/
  - Cons
    - entities cannot easily be validated in their entirety (but that
      shouldn't be necessary)
- Pros and Cons of Not-Always-Valid approach
  - Pros: (most of the) validations for an entity can be put in one place
  - Cons: =IsValid= has to be called explicitly, possibly multiple times
    during an operation (which might be forgotten)

* Further Enhancements when Developing with DDD

** Factories

- encapsulate complex creation logic (this shouldn't be the entity's
  responsibility and keeps entities simple)
- only introduce factories when necessary

** Domain and Application Services

- Domain services
  - hold domain knowledge that doesn't belong to entities or value
    objects
  - do not have a state
  - do not communicate with the outside world
- Application services
  - do not contain domain logic, like e.g. domain event dispatchers
    and handlers
  - can have a state (e.g. a ViewModel)
  - communicate with the outside world (e.g. UIs, external APIs)

* CQRS

- https://enterprisecraftsmanship.com/posts/types-of-cqrs/

* Anti-Patterns

** Anemic Domain Model

- domain entities are only data structures
- all domain logic is extracted to domain services
- encapsulation is broken because all field of the entities must be
  public (in order for domain services to be able to access them)
- https://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/AnemicDomainModel.html
- anemic domain models have two types of classes
  - /data/ classes: hold stat in data in public fields
  - /operation/ classes: stateless holding business rules
- Cons of anemic domain modeled
  - low discoverability (what domain objects can do is not obvious in
    their interface; can be mitigated by conventions)
  - more code duplication (because it is unclear where behavior can
    be found)
  - lacking encapsulation (see [[file:clean_code.org::#encapsulation][encapsulation]])
- Pros of anemic domain model
  - higher velocity in projects with no invariants to maintain
    (e.g. in functional programs where all data is immutable), in
    small projects or in the beginning of large projects

*** How to refactore anemic domain models into rich domain models

1. Decouple domain classes from application (layer) data contracts
   (e.g. API input an output data contracts) with DTOs (aka request
   and response models)
2. Introduce value objects to make the domain model more expressive
   (see also primitive obsession)

** Fat Entities

- entities hold too much logic, e.g. when
  - isolation of entities is broken (e.g. entities communicate with
    external layers or the database)
  - entities have unnatural responsibilities

** Returning partially initialized entities from Repositories

- always return fully initialized entities from repository methods
- partially initialized entities cannot ensure that they are always
  valid
- do not return entities when only partial data is returned (for
  performance reasons), like e.g. DTOS of atomic types (int, etc.)

** Mechanical approach to DDD

- automatic creation of entities with a corresponding repository,
  factory and domain services
- create domain types only when they are needed
- code generation of domain classes is a sign for mechanical approach
  to DDD.:;

* Testing

- additional sources
  - https://enterprisecraftsmanship.com/posts/test-induced-design-damage-or-why-tdd-is-so-painful/
  - https://enterprisecraftsmanship.com/posts/painless-tdd/
    - tests are a compromise between
      - protection against regressions
      - maintainability (resistance to refactoring)
      - speed
    - We need to (unit-)test only a specific type of code which
      - doesn't have external dependencies
      - Expresses your domain logic
  - https://enterprisecraftsmanship.com/posts/integration-testing-or-how-to-sleep-well-at-nights/
  - https://martinfowler.com/articles/is-tdd-dead/
- Code-first vs Test-first
  - Use test first when you know how the code should look like
  - use code-first when you are experimenting with different
    implementations

* Open Questions

- Why are snack machines and ATMs bounded context in the same solution
  space? What could the problem to a solution be that contains snack
  machines and ATMs?
- Could absence types be considered reference data? I.e. could we have
  static instances for all 50 types in code?
- Can entities exist outside of aggregates?
- What remains when geocoding, distance calculation and optimization
  are stripped from VISITOUR?
- Why don't we have domain events? E.g. when changing the type of a
  tour to an absence, the =TourEntity= could raise an event. The
  optimization service could listen for that event and escalate all
  calls on that tour. But maybe it has to be checked that the tour
  doesn't have any calls before setting an absence is allowed, i.e. we
  would need to call the optimization service even before we are
  allowed to set it, i.e. we can never check this in the =TourEntity=
  itself :( Is this a sign that our bounded contexts are badly cut?
