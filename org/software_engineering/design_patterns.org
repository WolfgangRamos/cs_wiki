** Facade

- a facade is a component that provides an improved interface for one
  or multiple existing components, i.e. a facade can hide
  - multiple components behind one interface
  - complex component(s) behind a simplified interface

** Adapter

- used to map one component's interface to a certain fixed target
  interface (i.e. the wrapper implements the target interface and maps
  calls to the wrapped components interface)
